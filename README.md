# Clustering

Imported 2 unlabeled datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Applied Dimensionality Reduction Technique (PCA) in order to reduce dimensions followed by Elbow Method for Kmeans to determine optimal number of clusters. Later, applied KMeans to perform clustering and also applied cluster validations which include davies bouldin index, silhouette index, homogenity, completeness score and Normalized Mutual Information between two clusterings.
Also performed Hierarchial clustering on the dataset by plotting dendograms to determine optimal number of clusters.
